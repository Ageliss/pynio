PyNIO ("pie-nee-oh") is a Python module that allows read and/or write
access to a variety of scientific data formats (NetCDF 3/4, GRIB1,
GRIB2, HDF4, HDF-EOS2, HDF-EOS5, shapefile, CCM History tape) using an
interface modelled on NetCDF.

Use of this software implies agreement of the PyNIO source code
license:

You can import this package with:

  import Nio

This version of PyNIO has been tested against Python 2.[6-7].x and
NumPy 1.[5-6].x.

Installation:
-------------

Required: Python 2.7 or higher and NumPy version 1.0 or higher.  For
this version, we used Python 2.7.1 and NumPy 1.6.0.  Earlier or later
versions of these packages may work, but we haven't tested all of
them.

Binary installation is simple:

    python setup.py install

This command may require root privileges on some systems.

Source code installation is not trivial. See the INSTALL file
in this directory.

Examples and tests:
---------

There are some PyNIO examples and tests in the "test" directory.

If you also have PyNGL installed, then you can type:

   pynglex nio01 nio02


Packaging:
---------------
1. create .tar.bz2 file:
	cd /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages
	tar -cjf pynio.tar.bz2 PyNIO PyNIO-1.4.1-py2.7.egg-info

2. create package

	conda package --pkg-name pynio --pkg-version 1.4.2

3. add channels

	conda config --add channels 'http://conda.binstar.org/huangwei'

Build a package from a (conda) recipe. (ADVANCED) For examples of recipes, see: https://github.com/pydata/conda-recipes

**usage**: ``conda build [-h] [-c] [--no-binstar-upload] [--output] [-s] [-t] [--no-test] [--build-recipe] PATH [PATH ...]``

*PATH*
        path to recipe directory

optional arguments:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
  -c, --check          only check (validate) the recipe
  --no-binstar-upload  do not ask to upload the package to binstar
  --output             output the conda package filename which would have been created and exit
  -s, --source         only obtain the source (but don't build)
  -t, --test           test package (assumes package is already build)
  --no-test            do not test the package

Using PIP to install/distribute software:

https://python-packaging-user-guide.readthedocs.org/en/latest/current.html

To use Setuptools in your project, the recommended way is to ship ez_setup.py alongside your setup.py script and call it at the very beginning of setup.py like this:

from ez_setup import use_setuptools
use_setuptools()



1. install setuptools:

curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/ez_setup.py -o - | python

or: python setup.py install --prefix=/Users/huangwei/anaconda (with source code).
